# ðŸ§© Interpreter Project (Work in Progress)

This is a **small interpreter** that Iâ€™m building while reading the book  
[_Crafting Interpreters_ by Robert Nystrom_](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).  
Itâ€™s an experimental project meant to help me understand **language design**, **lexing**, **parsing**, and **interpreting** â€” from the ground up.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project aims to implement a minimal interpreter capable of:
- Tokenizing source code (scanner / lexer)
- Parsing expressions and statements
- Evaluating expressions in an environment
- Eventually executing a subset of a programming language (Lox-inspired)

The repository includes experimental components such as:
- A **Lox-like interpreter** (`loxInterpreter/`)
- A **DOM-based HTML parser** (`DomParser/`, `Interpreter_js/`)
- Utility test files and prototypes (`test.js`, `test2.js`, `file.lox`)
